=head1 NAME

Razor2::Syslog -- Syslog support for Razor2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Razor2::Syslog;
  my $s=new Razor2::Syslog(Facility=>'local4',Priority=>'debug');
  $s->send('see this in syslog',Priority=>'info');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module has been derived from Net::Syslog. Some optimizations were
made to Net::Syslog, in particular support for keeping a socket open. What
follows is the documentation for Net::Syslog, which completely applies to
this module.

Net::Syslog implements the intra-host syslog forwarding protocol. It is
not intended to replace the Sys::Syslog or Unix::Syslog modules, but
instead to provide a method of using syslog when a local syslogd is
unavailable or when you don't want to write syslog messages to the
local syslog.

The new call sets up default values, any of which can be overridden in the
send call.  Keys (listed with default values) are:

	Name		<calling script name>
	Facility 	local5
	Priority 	err
	SyslogPort    	514
	SyslogHost    	127.0.0.1

Valid Facilities are:
	kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp, cron, 
	authpriv, ftp, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6

Valid Priorities are:
	emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug
